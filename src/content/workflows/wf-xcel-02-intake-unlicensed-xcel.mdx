# 1 — Intake — Unlicensed (XCEL)

Standard intake for unlicensed agents, setting deadlines and starting reminders.

## Trigger
- **Form Submitted**: Primary intake form.

## Logic / Steps
1. **XCEL Stage 1**: Update stage to "Intake Started".
2. **Enrollment Date Set**: Current date becomes the anchor for all future reminders.
3. **30 Day Due Date Set**: The system calculates +30 days as a hard deadline for licensing.
4. **Pre-Licensing Link for Login**: Automatic email delivery of course credentials.
5. **Add to Workflow**: Enrolls contact into `wf-xcel-03-xcel-drip-reminders`.

## Key Timing Logic
This workflow is responsible for **anchoring the timeline**. If an agent is enrolled multiple times, their due date may reset. The 30-day window is critical for identifying "Low Intent" agents who stall in pre-licensing.

## Fields
- **Writes**: `XCEL Stage 1`, `Enrollment Date`, `30 Day Due Date`
