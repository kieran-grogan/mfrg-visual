# BGA Reminders (Quility) * Review for Upline Logic

Sends reminders for Quility BGA tasks, similar logic to Equita reminders.

## Trigger
- **Added via workflow**: From monitoring workflows.

## Logic / Steps
1. **#1 Stage 3 Monitor Stage Level for Pipeline Movement**: API call.
2. **Send Reminder Pre-Req Met?**: Condition check.
   - **None**: `Wait (2) Days` → `Go To` (loop).
   - **Yes**: Sends `Quility - Email Reminder` (details similar to Equita).
