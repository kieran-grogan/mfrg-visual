## Workflow Journey
This automation is the **engine** of the pre-licensing phase. Once an agent starts their coursework, the system keeps them engaged via a series of strategically timed reminders.

## Step-by-Step Logic
1. **Engagement Loop**: The contact is enrolled in a multi-day wait-and-send sequence.
2. **Drip Content**: A mix of SMS and Email is sent to motivate the agent to finish their license testing.
3. **Holding Pattern**: The agent stays here until one of the "Conversion" triggers (like passing their test) pulls them out and into the next phase.

> [!NOTE]
> Since we don't have the internal builder view for this specific workflow, it is documented as a zoomed-out "Drip Sequence". If the sequence needs adjustment, look for the "XCEL Drip" folder in GHL.
