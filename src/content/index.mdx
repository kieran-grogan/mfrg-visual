# GHL XCEL + Contracting Interactive Guide

Welcome to the internal build guide for the GHL XCEL and Contracting automation system. This tool is designed to help VAs and Admins understand, troubleshoot, and maintain the complex logic that moves agents from pre-licensing to active contracting.

## How the system works

The system is split into two major phases, connected by a handover trigger:

### Phase 1: XCEL Onboarding (Pre-Licensing)
Agents start here if they are unlicensed. The system uses **automated drip reminders** to ensure they complete their courses. Once they pass their test and submit their NPN, they are automatically moved to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Contracting Pipeline
Once an agent is licensed, the system audits their profile via **SureLC API integrations**. It monitors their progress through three key stages:
1. **No Profile**: Verifying the agent exists in SureLC.
2. **At Producer**: Monitoring carrier appointment requests.
3. **BGA/Carrier**: Finalizing appointment status.
